# libmorpho
A library for simple mathematical morphology operations on images with arbritary shaped structuring elements

What is libmorpho?
libmorpho is a free software library written in ANSI C that implements several basic operations of mathematical morphology: erosions, dilations, openings, and closings by lines, rectangles, or arbitrary shaped structuring elements or by structuring functions. The software is released under the GNU General Public License
